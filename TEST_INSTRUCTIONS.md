# Testing Fix for Transaction Tagging Issue

## Issue
After tagging a transaction in the untagged section, it was not appearing in the "All Transactions" list even when filtering by the category it was tagged with.

## Root Cause
The React Query cache invalidation wasn't triggering an immediate refetch of the TransactionList component. The query was being invalidated but not actively refetched.

## Fix Applied
Updated `UntaggedTransactions.tsx` to:
1. Use `async/await` for query invalidation
2. Explicitly call `refetchQueries` with `type: "active"` to force immediate refetch of all mounted transaction queries
3. This ensures both the untagged list and the full transaction list update immediately

## Testing Steps

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend  
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the tagging workflow:**
   - Navigate to the Analytics dashboard
   - You should see two lists side-by-side:
     - Left: "Untagged Transactions"
     - Right: "Recent Transactions" (all transactions)
   
3. **Tag a transaction:**
   - In the left "Untagged Transactions" list, click "Tag" on any transaction
   - Select a category from the dropdown
   - Click "Save"
   
4. **Verify the fix:**
   - ✅ The transaction should immediately disappear from the left (untagged) list
   - ✅ The transaction should immediately appear in the right (all transactions) list
   - ✅ The transaction should show the correct category icon and name
   - ✅ The transaction should NOT have the "Unverified" badge anymore
   
5. **Test with category filter:**
   - In the right list, use the category dropdown to filter by the category you just tagged
   - ✅ The newly tagged transaction should appear in the filtered list
   - Select "All Categories" to see all transactions again

6. **Test with multiple transactions:**
   - Tag several transactions with different categories
   - Each should immediately move from left to right
   - Filter by different categories to verify they all appear correctly

## Expected Behavior
- **Before fix:** Transaction disappeared from left list but didn't appear in right list until page refresh
- **After fix:** Transaction moves from left list to right list immediately (within ~1 second)

## Technical Details
The fix uses React Query's `refetchQueries` with `type: "active"` to ensure all currently mounted queries with keys starting with `["transactions"]` are refetched. This includes:
- `["transactions", "untagged"]` - Untagged transactions list
- `["transactions", "all", filterCategory, limit]` - All transactions list
