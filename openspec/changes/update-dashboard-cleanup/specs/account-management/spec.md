# Account Management Specification (Delta)

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Account Deletion
The system SHALL allow users to delete connected accounts, and when an account is deleted, all associated transactions SHALL be automatically deleted (cascade delete).

#### Scenario: Delete account with cascade
- **WHEN** user deletes an account
- **THEN** the account is removed from the database
- **AND** all transactions associated with that account are automatically deleted
- **AND** no orphaned transaction records remain
- **AND** user is not presented with an option to keep transactions

#### Scenario: Confirm cascade deletion
- **WHEN** user initiates account deletion
- **THEN** a confirmation dialog warns that the account and all its transactions will be deleted
- **AND** the warning clearly states that transaction data will be permanently removed
- **AND** user must explicitly confirm before deletion proceeds
