- **THEN** both frontend and backend servers start concurrently
- **AND** changes in either package trigger hot reload

### Requirement: Frontend Package Structure
The frontend package SHALL be configured with React 18+, Vite, TypeScript, DaisyUI, TanStack Query, and React Router v6.

- **WHEN** a developer starts the frontend dev server
- **THEN** Vite serves the React application on localhost:5173
- **AND** hot module replacement works for component changes
- **AND** TypeScript compilation errors are displayed

#### Scenario: Frontend build
- **WHEN** a developer runs the frontend build command

#### Scenario: Database initialization
- **WHEN** the backend server starts for the first time
- **THEN** LowDB creates the database file if it doesn't exist
- **AND** default schema is initialized

### Requirement: Development Environment
The project SHALL provide convenient development scripts and proper .gitignore configuration.

#### Scenario: Development workflow
- **WHEN** a developer clones the repository and runs setup commands
- **THEN** all dependencies install correctly
- **AND** both frontend and backend can be started with a single command
- **AND** changes are automatically reflected without manual restarts

#### Scenario: Version control
