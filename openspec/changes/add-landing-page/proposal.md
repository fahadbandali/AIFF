# Landing Page Proposal

## Why
Users need an entry point to the application that clearly communicates its value proposition and provides access to the main application. A landing page serves as the first impression and guides users to sign in or learn more about the app's capabilities.

## What Changes
- Create a responsive landing page component with DaisyUI styling
- Display hero section with application name and tagline
- Highlight 2-3 core features:
  1. **Bank Connection** - Securely connect accounts via Plaid
  2. **Smart Categorization** - Automatic transaction categorization with custom rules
  3. **Budget Tracking** - Visual budget management with spending insights
- Add prominent "Sign In" call-to-action button
- Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Use DaisyUI theming for light/dark mode support

## Impact
- **Affected specs**: `landing-page` (new capability)
- **Affected code**: 
  - `frontend/src/components/Landing/` - New landing page component
  - `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Add routing for landing page
  - `frontend/src/index.css` - Any custom styles if needed
- **Dependencies**: React Router v6 for navigation, DaisyUI for UI components
