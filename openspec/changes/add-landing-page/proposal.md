# Landing Page Proposal

## Why
Users need an entry point to the application that clearly communicates its value proposition and provides access to the main application. A landing page serves as the first impression and guides users to the dashboard where they can start using the app.

## What Changes
- Refactor the basic landing page in `App.tsx` into a proper component structure
- Create a responsive landing page component with DaisyUI styling
- Display hero section with application name "AIFF" and descriptive tagline
- Highlight 3 core features with visual cards:
  1. **Bank Connection** - Securely connect accounts via Plaid
  2. **Smart Categorization** - Automatic transaction categorization with custom rules
  3. **Budget Tracking** - Visual budget management with spending insights
- Add prominent "Get Started" call-to-action button that navigates to `/dashboard`
- Implement responsive design for mobile and desktop (stacked on mobile, horizontal on desktop)
- Leverage DaisyUI theming for built-in light/dark mode support

## Impact
- **Affected specs**: `landing-page` (new capability)
- **Affected code**: 
  - `frontend/src/components/Landing/` - New landing page component structure
    - `LandingPage.tsx` - Main landing page component
    - `Hero.tsx` - Hero section component
    - `FeatureCard.tsx` - Reusable feature card component
  - `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Refactor to use new Landing component
- **Dependencies**: 
  - React Router v6 (already installed) - for navigation
  - DaisyUI (already installed) - for UI components and theming
  - React 18+ (already installed) - for component structure
