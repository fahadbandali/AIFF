# Implementation Tasks

## 1. Update Analytics Dashboard Layout
- [x] 1.1 Modify `AnalyticsDashboard.tsx` to create a two-column grid layout for transaction components
- [x] 1.2 Position UntaggedTransactions component on the left side
- [x] 1.3 Position TransactionList component on the right side
- [x] 1.4 Add appropriate spacing and dividers between the two columns
- [x] 1.5 Ensure both components have equal height or proper alignment

## 2. Make Layout Responsive
- [x] 2.1 Add responsive Tailwind classes for desktop view (>= 1024px, two columns)
- [x] 2.2 Add responsive Tailwind classes for tablet view (768px - 1023px, two columns with adjusted widths)
- [x] 2.3 Add responsive Tailwind classes for mobile view (< 768px, stacked vertically)
- [x] 2.4 Test layout on various screen sizes to ensure proper rendering

## 3. Update UntaggedTransactions Component
- [x] 3.1 Review component styling for narrower width in side-by-side layout
- [x] 3.2 Adjust card padding or layout if needed for better space utilization
- [x] 3.3 Ensure dropdown and buttons remain usable in narrower width
- [x] 3.4 Test component behavior when in side-by-side layout

## 4. Update TransactionList Component
- [x] 4.1 Review component styling for narrower width in side-by-side layout
- [x] 4.2 Consider making table scrollable horizontally on smaller widths if needed
- [x] 4.3 Ensure filter dropdown remains accessible
- [x] 4.4 Test component behavior when in side-by-side layout

## 5. Verify Real-time Update Behavior
- [x] 5.1 Verify that tagging a transaction in UntaggedTransactions invalidates the transaction list query
- [x] 5.2 Ensure TransactionList automatically updates when a transaction is tagged
- [x] 5.3 Test with multiple transactions to ensure smooth transitions
- [x] 5.4 Verify query cache invalidation is working correctly

## 6. Add Visual Feedback (Optional Enhancement)
- [-] 6.1 Consider adding a brief animation or highlight when a transaction appears in the full list
- [x] 6.2 Add success toast notification that confirms the transaction was tagged (already implemented)
- [x] 6.3 Ensure visual feedback doesn't interfere with user workflow

## 7. Testing
- [x] 7.1 Test side-by-side layout on desktop resolution
- [x] 7.2 Test responsive layout on tablet and mobile resolutions
- [x] 7.3 Test tagging workflow: verify transactions move from left to right
- [x] 7.4 Test with empty states (no untagged transactions, no transactions)
- [x] 7.5 Test with large number of transactions (scrolling behavior)
- [x] 7.6 Test filter dropdown in TransactionList while in side-by-side layout

## 8. Documentation
- [x] 8.1 Update any relevant UI screenshots or documentation (not applicable - no screenshots in repo)
- [x] 8.2 Note the responsive breakpoints in code comments if helpful (standard Tailwind breakpoints used)

## 9. Bug Fixes
- [x] 9.1 Fix query invalidation issue - transactions not appearing in all list after tagging
- [x] 9.2 Add explicit refetchQueries with type: "active" to force immediate refetch
- [x] 9.3 Use async/await in onSuccess handler for proper sequencing
- [x] 9.4 Create testing instructions document for verification
