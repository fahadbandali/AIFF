## Notes
- Tasks should be completed in order within each section
- Sections 1-3 are prerequisites for section 4
- Section 5 depends on section 1 (backend APIs)
- Section 6 should be completed alongside other sections
- Section 7-8 can be done incrementally after main features work
- Remember to run linter and fix any errors after each task
- Test with multiple Plaid sandbox accounts for comprehensive coverage
